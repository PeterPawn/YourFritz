If you'd prefer to read the description in german, you could
look for a file 'README.ger' within the package. If it's not
present, I'm still writing it.

WHY THAT PACKAGE ?
==================
The purpose of this package is a root file system modification
"on the fly" for AVM's FRITZ!Box 7490 router devices to regain 
the ability to execute own services after some very new and
unexpected behavior changes within the original firmware. 

In my opinion these changes are - after an annoying incident in 
the past - a very first step in the right direction. 
But the the absence of a defined hook is upsetting for some 
user-supplied extensions to the firmware, which attracted a wide
interest in the past and an "advanced mode" for experienced users
seems to be out of sight in the near future.

QUICKSTART
==========
Unpack, check integrity and call the script to modify the running
system.

# ./modfs

After some checks of your system and after answering the one or
other question to apply or deny a modification, your system will
be changed and you can reboot it. The modified root file system
will be used after that restart.

SUPPORTED MODELS
================
7490   - thoroughly tested
7362SL - only one box tested yet (09-23-2014), not as easy to
         handle as the 7490 due to lack of free space at RAM and
         NAND, but it's possible with >256MB of free space on an
         USB volume; be aware, that it's *slower a lot* while 
         packing the new file system

It looks like devices have to be updated to a firmware version
>= 06.10 first to get the ability to 'dual boot' under abuse of
the 'hot flash' capability.
It's possible that the boot loader EVA is able to select the boot
partition with the 'linux_fs_start' variable at the outset, but it
seems to be unused up to firmware version 06.10. But there was no
thorough investigation yet ... I would need additional feedback,
because I do not own enough different devices myself.

If you'd like to add support for your own device yourself, be
aware of the requirement to supply an unsquashfs/mksquashfs pair
of utilities too (or to create another symlink to the present
utilities (compiled for VR9 processors)  within the 'bin' sub-
directory with the appropriate hardware revision number part). 
An additional FTP server path ('ftp_path_${hwrev}') is needed and 
the new hardware revision has to be put into the 
'hwrevs_supported' variable. 
After you've tested the changes and everything is working as 
expected, I'd feel happy about a short note to my e-mail address
with the specifications of your device.

HOW IT WORKS
============
The script first checks your device to make sure, that all the
needed requirements are satisfied. The requirements are in detail:

- the hardware revision of the device is found within the list of
  supported devices (hwrevs_supported)
- the environment variable to select the boot time partition for
  the EVA loader is present and valid (linux_fs_start)
- the variable mentioned above points to the running system yet

The conditions above are tested too, if you want to undo an
earlier modification while you've not restarted the device.
If there's no 'undo' request to handle (see below), the following
conditions are tested now:

- the system has to have a MTD partition named 'kernel' and a
  corresponding file system partition 'filesystem'
- there has to be a mirrored kernel and file system partition with
  the 'reserved-' prefix to the names
- if one of the partitions above is missing, even an earlier check
  (to detect an already modified root file system) could have 
  failed already
- the kernel images are compared (based on their MD5 hash values)
  and if there are different kernel versions found, the user will
  get the opportunity to copy the running system to the inactive
  partitions too and start over the modification process after
  restarting the whole device
- the available space at the tmpfs (that's a volatile storage at
  the RAM of the device) will be checked
- at last prerequisite there has to be enough free storage (either
  at the tmpfs, the NAND flash or an USB volume) to unpack, modify
  and repack the root file system; if such a place is found at a
  file system without linux rights management, a loopback device
  with an ext3 file system image will be used

If all of the above conditions are complied with, the user has to
choose a base for the modifications. There are three possible 
origins:

1. The root file system image of the running system.
2. The root file system image extracted from a new download of a
   firmware image from manufacturer's FTP server.
3. An earlier extracted or saved image file, which could be a
   complete firmware image (usually a tar file with an 'image'
   extension) or an already extracted squashfs root image, but
   not a 'wrapper' image.

The root file system of the running OS may contain some changes
compared to the original file system already. It's solely the
responsibility of a modscript to detect if such changes are 
present and to avoid an invalid result of 'double' modifications.
The included script examples will take care about it.
If the user decided to download a fresh system copy from the FTP
server, he is given a chance to save the extracted root file
system image for later use to persistent storage, if it's present.
If he wants to use an earlier saved image file, he's given the
opportunity to select a mounted drive (even the yaffs2 image at
the NAND space presented to the user is seen as a 'drive', but it
has enough free space at the 7490 model only at the time of this
writing), where the saved image will be searched. If has to have
an appropriate file name for this 'automatic search', else it
will not be found.
Another chance to point the script to the correct template is to
enter the full path to it. But beware, there's no edit capability
while entering the name due to missing readline support for the
'read' command within AVM's busybox. I was not interested in 
writing my own line editor with ANSI control sequences, so you
have to take what you get there. If you've made a mistake while
typing, press 'return' and start the input again, after the file
was not found.

After looking for suitable places to store the intermediate
results of processing, an overview of that places is shown and
one has to be choosen by the user.
If the selected place isn't using a native linux file system, a
container image will be unpacked (128MB ext3 file system stored
as compressed file in the 'files' subdirectory) and mounted via
a loopback device. All further file operations will then be done
within that container. After processing has finished, the image
will be dismounted and removed without any chance to store it
elsewhere. In my opinion it's useless to save that intermediate
result for later use, you've to waste the time it takes to 
prepare the image at every call. If you'd like to cut short here,
you can prepare your own container and mount it prior to calling
the script again.

At the next step, the squashfs root image is unpacked and the
block size and endianess of the present image is recorded.

Now the modification process will take place. 
Every file found within the 'modscripts' subdirectory is written
to a list file, which will be sorted alphabetically next. 
The resulting file is read line by line and the executable flags 
of every file found are examined. To be recognized as a modscript,
the flags have to be set as 'ug+x' at least (the file has to be 
readable too). If the 'o+x' flag is present too, the script will 
be executed at first pass without any user intervention possible. 

The order of calls to the script will be described later, see 
below for an explanation.

After the first pass is done, every processed modscript name will
be removed from the list file and the second pass starts. Now
every file is examined again and if its flags are set as expected,
the user gets a display of the script name, its description and
the decision to apply or deny that modification.

After all modscripts have been processed, the resulting file
system tree will be packed again. This process will take some 
time.

On a 7490 device packing the 55MB of the 06.20 root file system 
tree into a 21MB image file was done after 3 minutes. All file 
I/O took place at the fast tmpfs only during that measure.

If you use a slower storage device (which is additonally slowed
down due to using a loopback device) or your router is equipped
with another (probably slower) processing unit, it could take
ages to finish packing.

After the new root file system image has been packed, it will be
copied into wrapper file system at the unused partition.

If no error occured until this point, the environment variable
'linux_fs_start' will be set to the alternative value to select
the unused partitions as active system at next restart of your
router.

After some cleanup actions (removing a mounted container image
and removing all intermediate directories and files) the script
is finished.

You're in charge to check the made modifications before you
restart your router. There is an interactive step before the
packing of the new image starts. While the script is waiting for
your reaction, you're able to inspect the resulting file system
tree at the displayed location. If you suppose any mistakes, you
can enter a single 'q' letter at that point and the script will
not waste your time while packing an unusable file system image.

If you've finished the whole process and decide later (but 
before the next restart) to abandon your changes, you can call
the script with 'undo' as argument. If the preliminary checks
will succeed (especially, if the linux_fs_start value was set
to start the inactive system next time), the linux_fs_start
value will be set back to the running system. The changes to
to root file system image within the inactive wrapper will not
be undone. Another run of the script or the next regular 
firmware update will overwrite the file system image later.

Changes 05/11/2015:
Added an 'update' parameter to load a newer version from the FTP
server, in this mode the prerequisite of identical system
versions in both flash storage sets is not checked. An update
will only be detected, if the new version number is higher than
the running system's version.
If an additional file name is specified after the 'update'
parameter, no version check will be done and the specified file
will be used as the modification source (it has to be an firm-
ware image file with 'kernel.image' and 'filesystem.image' con-
tained within). The user is responsible to ensure the compati-
bility of existing settings or to clean existing ones.

SUPPLIED MODSCRIPTS
===================
I've added only four 'basic' modscripts to regain the bread and 
butter function of executing the shell commands in the TFFS file
'rc.user', which was called 'debug.cfg' by the manufacturer.

One script enables the execution of that commands at the very
end of the init process. That's the only modification, which
will be done without user's approval (that means, the script
has the "executable for others" flag set).

A second one modifies the 'shell profile' at /etc/profile to 
check for the presence of another file at /var/custom/profile 
and 'source' that file as final action, if it exists.

The third script will create a new command called 'edit_rcuser',
which can (and should) be used to modify the commands within the 
rc.user file stored at the TFFS.
This new command is intended to replace the 'nvi' command for 
rc.user. If you use it to edit the file, any unnecessary writes
(if you had a look at the content only and made no changes or if
you decide to reject your changes after writing to the file) are
avoided. But the most important difference to 'nvi' is, that the
rc.user (or even debug.cfg, if you prefer that name) file can be
modified without any needs to create an appropriate char-device
for the minor id 98 first. The 'edit_rcuser' command will create
it as neccessary and remove it later too. 
Because the latest changes to the original firmware 'hide' the
existence of that file, my modification in the first supplied
script will not change that point to prevent any unwanted side
effects (a.e. from writing an "empty file" into that node).

The fourth script adds two radio buttons to the original 'restart'
page (or frame) to select the system to load after next restart.
To function properly, it needs an additional shell script called
'guibootmanager' anywhere within the root file system tree and a
modification to the file /usr/www/<branding>/system/reboot.lua.
If your device can use more than one possible branding, only the
file with the selected branding as of the time running the script
will be modified.

WHY DO YOU NOT USE A PREDEFINED PACKAGE FORMAT ?
================================================
There is no builtin support for any predefined package format at
the regular firmware from the manufacturer. Because the whole
script has to run the first time on such an original system, I
wanted to avoid any unnecessary dependency on other binaries.
I did not find a usable solution to exchange the supplied tools
for squashfs images (unsquashfs and mksquashfs) with a scripted
shell based solution, so I had to swallow that particular toad.

WRITING YOUR OWN MODSCRIPTS
===========================
Each modscript has to start with a defined header. Each header
line is a shell comment (starting with a hash sign - #), which
consists of a keyword and - depending on the keyword - one or
more options. The following keywords are known:

MODFS_MODSCRIPT (mandatory)
- this is the first line of the header, it takes no options

EOH (mandatory)
- this is the last line of the header, it take no options

SUPPORTS (mandatory)
- that keyword defines the supported calls to the script and 
  the supported languages for error messages and/or generated 
  code as part of a modification

NAME (mandatory)
- here you have to specify a short name for the modification

DESCRIPTION [language] (optional, mandatory for 'onrequest')
- the next (one or more) line(s) contains a description for the
  modification in the specified language; if no language is 
  specified or the script does not support different languages,
  the description is used as a fallback variant for unknown or
  unsupported languages
- a description is not needed, if the script will be executed
  without user's approval only

The SUPPORTS keyword describes the supported languages and the
wanted calls in different stages of processing. The execution
of a modification script will be splitted into three phases.
First, a prerequisites check can be executed. If the script 
finds any circumstances which should lead to a block of further
actions for that script (a.e. the modification is present
already), it can return an exit code of 1 and the calling script
will not process any further steps for the running modscript.
The support for that 'preflight check' is expressed with the
'precheck' option at the 'SUPPORTS' line.
The next (and only mandatory supported) step is called 'install'.
During this step the script should modify and/or create all files
that build up the modification.
The last possible step can be used to check the success of a
modification. The support for this step is signalled with the
'postcheck' option.
The supported languages are specified with the 'language' option
followed by a comma separated list of language codes (ISO 639-1)
which is enclosed in parentheses (a.e. 'language(de,en)').

The script will be called with the busybox shell at the router,
specifying the following parameters as arguments:

<language> <root directory> <mode> <step>

'language' is the required interface language for message display
and code generation.
'root directory' is the base directory of the new file system.
'mode' will be set to 'auto' at first pass of script execution
and to 'onrequest' during the second pass.
'step' will be set to 'precheck', 'install' or 'postcheck'
according to the current state of execution.

The script has to return an exit code of 0, if it made a new
modification to the file system tree or 1, if no modification
took place.
Any other exit code will abort of the execution of the modfs 
script after all modscripts have been processed.
Any messages written by the modscript to stdout will be shown
after the progress messages. Output to stderr should be avoided,
it would ruin the progress messages.
